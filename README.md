"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other." -- [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/)

advent of code requests that people not commit the prompts/questions/assignments so I have refrained from doing so. The ones where I think my solutions are cleanest are 3, 4, and 6.
